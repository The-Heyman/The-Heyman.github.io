    <p>This is the ultimate Rock paper scissors game. In a game set, the winner is determined by the first player to reach three wins. 
      Rock wins against scissors, paper wins against rock, and scissors wins against paper. If the same move is thrown by both players, it results in a stalemate (draw). The player to first reach 3 wins is crowned winner. 
      
      Available on iPhone and iPad
      
      Have fun! </p>

        <p>I am a cloud automation Engineer by day and a lot more by night including iOS development, which I just picked up a couple of months ago. I am very happy I have been able to publish my 1st iOS app to the app store and I look forward to making releasing new features for this app. I encourage you to use my app and let me know your feedback and feature suggestions. In the meantime, I will be cooking my next app. Watch this space!
